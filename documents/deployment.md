# Deployment Strategy: 

Split deployment strategy. This separates the static frontend (which Vercel excels at hosting) from the dynamic backend (which requires persistent connections for Socket.io's WebSockets, something Vercel still handles poorly in its serverless functions as of mid-2025). This approach ensures low-latency real-time performance, scalability for multiplayer, and cost-effectiveness on free tiers during development/testing. 


## Frontend: Vercel
Why? Optimized for static/JS apps; auto-deploys from Git, global edge network for low-latency asset delivery (critical for Phaser loading). Handles TypeScript/Vite builds seamlessly.serveravatar.com
Steps:
Build locally: npm run build (outputs to /dist).
Push to GitHub.
Connect repo to Vercel dashboard; set root to /frontend (for your separate frontend folder).
Deploy—gets a URL like my-game.vercel.app.
Cost: Free for hobby (unlimited bandwidth); scales to pro if needed.
Caveats: No backend here; client Socket.io connects to backend URL (hardcode or use env vars).

## Backend: Render.com (Primary Recommendation) or Railway.app (Alternative)
Why Render? Excellent for Node.js + Socket.io; supports persistent services, auto-scaling, free SSL, and WebSockets without timeouts. Built-in logs/metrics for debugging multiplayer issues. Community favors it for games over Vercel in 2025 due to backend flexibility.getdeploying.comedgeone.ai Railway is similar but simpler for beginners.
Steps (for Render):
Create a "Web Service" in dashboard.
Connect GitHub repo (point to /backend).
Set runtime: Node.js; start command: node dist/server.js (or ts-node for dev).
Add env vars (e.g., PORT=443 for HTTPS).
Deploy—gets a URL like my-socket.onrender.com.
Update frontend Socket.io client: io('https://my-socket.onrender.com').
Cost: Free tier (500ms CPU/month, good for testing); paid starts at ~$7/month for always-on.

## Database: PostgreSQL on Render
Why PostgreSQL on Render? Native PostgreSQL support, automatic backups, connection pooling, and seamless integration with your backend service. Render's managed PostgreSQL eliminates database administration overhead.
Steps:
Create a "PostgreSQL" service in Render dashboard.
Choose plan: Free tier (1GB storage, 1 month retention) or paid ($7/month for 10GB).
Copy the connection string (Internal Database URL for backend, External for local development).
Add DATABASE_URL to your backend service environment variables.
Run Prisma migrations: npx prisma migrate deploy in your build command.
Seed initial data: npx prisma db seed (optional).
Local Development: Use Docker or local PostgreSQL instance with separate DATABASE_URL.
Cost: Free tier available; production starts at $7/month for persistent data.
