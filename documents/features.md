## Key Features Breakdown

| Category | Feature | Description | Implementation Notes | Priority |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Core Gameplay** | Character Controls & Physics | Basic movement (run, jump, double-jump), attacks (light/heavy/special), knockback on hits, health/damage system, and edge guarding (falling off stage loses a stock). | Use Phaser's Arcade Physics for gravity/collisions. Define a `Player` class with keyboard inputs (e.g., WASD for move, space for jump, keys for attacks). Sync positions/actions via Socket.io emits. | High (Foundation for all modes; build on Day 3). |
| **Core Gameplay** | Combat Mechanics | Hitboxes for attacks, combos, shielding/dodging, and projectiles (if character-specific). | Extend Phaser sprites with animations (load spritesheets in preload). Server validates hits for consistency. | High (Makes it feel like a fighter; integrate early for testing). |
| **Selection/Customization** | Character Selection | Choose from 5 characters with different attributes (e.g., speed vs. power: Fast lightweight, balanced all-rounder, heavy hitter). Each has unique stats (jump height, attack damage) and 1-2 special moves. | Menu scene in Phaser with clickable sprites. Store attributes in a TS interface (e.g., `CharacterStats { speed: number; }`). Unlock more via progression. | High (User-mentioned; add on Day 5 for progression). |
| **Selection/Customization** | Stage Selection | Pick from 3 stages (e.g., flat arena, multi-platform, hazardous with moving parts). Stages affect gameplay (e.g., hazards deal damage). | Load tilemaps/sprites in Phaser scenes. Host selects stage in lobby; sync to clients. | High (User-mentioned; simple to implement with Phaser tilemaps). |
| **Modes** | Multiplayer Mode | Real-time battles with 2-4 players over the web. Lobby for joining/starting games, chat implemented but optional for users (toggleable). Handle joins/disconnects gracefully. | Socket.io rooms for matches (e.g., emit 'joinGame'). Client predicts movements locally, server reconciles for low latency. Deploy to Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend). | High (Assignment core: Real-time interaction; focus Days 4-5). |
| **Modes** | **[POST-MVP] Single-Player Mode** | Practice mode: Run around the stage alone, or fight a dummy (static target that takes hits but doesn't fight back). No AI yetâ€”add bot later. | Reuse multiplayer code but without remote players. Spawn a dummy sprite with health; player actions affect it locally (no server sync needed). | POST-MVP |
| **Progression/Engagement** | Unlocks & Advancement | Win matches to earn points; use to unlock characters/stages. Simple storyline (e.g., "Climb the fighter ranks"). | Track wins server-side (store in memory or simple DB if needed). Emit unlocks to clients. Add levels (e.g., best-of-3 matches). | Med (Assignment req: Levels/progression; ties to fun factor; Day 5). |
| **Progression/Engagement** | UI/Feedback | Health bars, stock counters (lives), win/lose screens, sound effects (hits, jumps). | Phaser text/sprites for UI. Free assets from OpenGameArt. Balance via playtesting (e.g., tweak attributes). | Med (Enhances polish; Day 6). |
| **Technical/Polish** | Configuration Management | Centralized database-driven game constants system enabling real-time balancing without code deployments. All physics, combat, character stats, and game rules stored in database with strict validation. | PostgreSQL database with Game Constants API. Frontend fetches all constants on startup via `/api/constants`. No fallback logic - fail fast if database unavailable. Server-side caching (1min) for performance. | High (Enables live game balancing and eliminates hardcoded values). |
| **Technical/Polish** | Performance & Testing | Low-latency syncing, optimization for 60FPS, Jest unit/integration tests for mechanics/networking. | Profile with Chrome DevTools; mock in tests (e.g., player jumps). Stress test with multiple tabs. | High (Assignment: No lag, code quality; integrate throughout). |
| **Technical/Polish** | Cross-Device Support | Web-based, responsive canvas (scale for mobile/desktop). | Phaser's scale manager. Test on browsers; no installs needed. | Low (Nice-to-have; check on Day 7). |
| **Infrastructure** | Account & Authentication | User registration, login, JWT access & refresh tokens, secure stateless auth for REST and Socket.io. | Passport.js local + JWT strategies on backend, token refresh flow, frontend login/register UI with token storage and automatic Socket authentication. | High |
